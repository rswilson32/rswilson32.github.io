                <p>I've always loved biking, so I was ecstatic to get a free annual Metro Bikeshare pass this last spring. For a better explanation on what this means, this exerpt is from the <a href="https://bikeshare.metro.net/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metro bikeshare website:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Metro Bike Share system makes bikes available 24/7, 365 days a year in Downtown LA, Central LA, Hollywood, North Hollywood and on the Westside. Metro Bike Share offers convenient round-the-clock access to a fleet of bicycles for short trips. Metro Bike Share is one of LA Metro's multiple public transportation options for Angelenos and visitors to get around.<br><br>Metro Bike Share is a fast, easy, and fun way to ride, anytime. Get a bike from any Metro Bike Share station, go for a ride, and properly return it. It’s easy — just like riding a bike!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since getting my membership, I've been able to bike to my classes, the grocery store, the gym, and more. It's faster than walking, I avoid traffic, and it's overall just fun! I've rarely had issues of crowded stations or empty stations at UCLA, and even if I did, there were always some nearby in Westwood.</p>
<p>One weekend, my friend and I went to Santa Monica beach, and it was surprisingly a LOT harder to use Metro Bikeshare. Stations were often full and over half a mile away, and at the Metro E line station, there were more people waiting to lock a bike then to rent one!</p>
<p>With this experience in mind, I wanted to study how popular Metro Bikeshare stations and routes were across Los Angeles. Using LA's <a href="https://bikeshare.metro.net/about/data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public data</a>, this project is an analysis of Metro Bikeshare's demand over the past year.</p>
<div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" style="border: 1; display: block; margin: auto;" src="https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/10/bike_cal.html">&lt;\iframe&gt;</iframe></div>
<div style="float: right; width: 60%;"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="620" height="620" style="border: 1; display: block; margin: auto;" src="https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/10/station_popularity.html">&lt;\iframe&gt;</iframe></div></div>
<p>It's instantly noticeable that Metro Bikeshare has gained popularity in the past year. An average of xx bikes were rented per day in 2021 (except for 900+ each day of September: was there some promotional?), but ever since, there were xxx bike... And one thing to keep in mind here is that Metro has always been adding new stations, which adds to increased popularity. The Burbank stations weren't built until January 2021, and the UCLA stations that I use weren't built until January of 2023. I decided to normalize the average number of rentals by month because of the extreme popularity of certain stations, but from before, it's noticeable how much more popular Metro Bikeshare is now from just two and a half years ago. Which brings me to my original question: In which regions is bikeshare demand higher than others, and how should Metro Bikeshare act?</p>
<p> </p>
<div style="float: right; width: 60%;"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="620" height="620" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/10/freq_map.html">&lt;\iframe&gt;</iframe></div></div>
<p style="margin: 0;">For the following visuals, I've decided to normalize the number of bike rentals per station for readability. And, if there are k stations, the k/2 most popular routes are graphed. By hovering over a station (dot), you get more information, including its station number, name, and average number of rentals per day. My code is available on my GitHub.</p>
<p>It's clear to see that the most popular routes are along Santa Monica's oceanfront, UCLA's campus, Culver City, USC's campus, and downtown Los Angeles. Metro also divides these stations into 3 regions: Santa Monica (2), DTLA (9), and Burbank (1). We can focus on these regions for better analysis.</p>
<p> </p>
<select id="plotDropdown1">
<option value="freq_2">Region 2</option>
<option value="freq_19">Region 1, 9</option>
</select>
<div id="plotContainer1" style="float: right; width: 60%;"></div>
<p style="margin: 0;">(Note: for these dropdown menus, please click on an option to have a map appear! I don't know how to fix this). By subsetting for region 2, almost all of the most frequent routes connect to the Downtown Santa Monica E Line station (station 4215) and Ocean Front walk &amp; Navy (station 4214), which have an average of 60 rentals a day! Seeing as Santa Monica is a touristy spot, my guess is that most of these rentals are by those interested in riding along the beach or through downtown, and not necessarily for communting (station 4544 at Dockweiler Beach, has on average 14 rentals per day. Seeing as its the southern-most station on the beach, we can assume that these trips aren't for commuting).</p>
<p style="margin: 0;">It's also interesting that even though UCLA's stations were built relatively later, their routes are still very prominent. It would be great to build more stations in Westwood to encourage students that want to bike to class.</p>
<p style="margin: 0;">If we focus on DTLA and Burbank, we see a spider-web of routes thorugh downtown, with 7th &amp; Flower (station 3005) being the most popular, with on average 38 rentals per day. USC is also a popular hub. I find it interesting there are not many popular routes in North Hollywood! They are relatively new stations, but still.</p>
<p> </p>
<select id="plotDropdown2">
<option value="freq_walk">Walk-Up</option>
<option value="freq_day">Daily Pass</option>
<option value="freq_month">Monthly Pass</option>
<option value="freq_annual">Annual Pass</option>
</select>
<div id="plotContainer2" style="float: left; width: 60%;"></div>
<p>
<script>
		const plotDropdown1 = document.getElementById("plotDropdown1");
		const plotContainer1 = document.getElementById("plotContainer1");

		const plotDropdown2 = document.getElementById("plotDropdown2");
		const plotContainer2 = document.getElementById("plotContainer2");

		function updateIframe(selectedPlot, plotContainer) {
			plotContainer.innerHTML = ""; // Clear the container

			if (selectedPlot) {
				const iframe = document.createElement("iframe");
				iframe.width = "620";
				iframe.height = "620";
				iframe.scrolling = "no";
				iframe.frameBorder = "0";
				iframe.src = `https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/10/${selectedPlot}.html`;
				plotContainer.appendChild(iframe);
			}
		}

		plotDropdown1.addEventListener("change", function() {
			updateIframe(plotDropdown1.value, plotContainer1);
		});

		plotDropdown2.addEventListener("change", function() {
			updateIframe(plotDropdown2.value, plotContainer2);
		});
	</script>
</p>
<p style="margin: 0;">When we begin to filter by rental types, we get even more interesting results. A Metro bike rider has two options when renting a bike: they can either rent a bike on the spot, or use their TAP account with a membership (daily, monthly or annual). And if we look at just walk-up and daily pass rentals, nearly all of them are at Santa Monica! In fact, almost 75% of all rentals from stations 4214 and 4215 each day are from walk-up and day pass rentals. Given that Santa Monica, especially its Pier and beach, are big touristy attractions, we can guess that most of these rentals are tourists wanting to bike along beach sidewalks. And if they can't find a free station along the beach, they'll drop off their bike a few blocks in. </p>
<p>However monthly pass rentals, and especially annual pass rentals, are almost exclusively in downtown LA, USC, UCLA and Culver City, which we can guess are for commutes. However, even the most popular station for annual rentals, Figueroa &amp; 8th (station 3035), only averages around 4 rentals per day from annual pass holders! For a better understanding of this, the following graph shows that a vast majority of bike rents are from monthly pass holders, which has interestingly has accounted for the steady increase number of rentals over the past 2.5 years. (This sort of makes sense: tourists don't need a monthly or annual pass, and I can see a lot of new riders not wanting to spend money for an annual pass right off the bat).</p>
<div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="800" height="300" style="border: 1; display: block; margin: auto;" src="https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/10/stacked.html">
		&lt;\iframe&gt;</iframe></div>
<p>So far, all of my analysis has been on Metro Bikeshare's public, downloadable data. Which is great! But something I really wanted to look into was Metro's API, which gives realtime information on the number of bikes at each station.</p>
<p>With this API, along with various station attributes, such as working status and total bike capacity, I was able to map the average capacity of each station over the past 2.5 years.<div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="800" height="400" style="border: 1; display: block; margin: auto;" src="https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/10/bike_avg_capacity.html">
		&lt;\iframe&gt;</iframe></div>
<p>Remember how I said that I couldn't find anywhere to lock my bike at station 4215 near the E-Line in Santa Monica? I was not surprised to find out that this station is usually at 100% capacity! (This isn't always entirely possible, but it should be noted that Metro Bikeshare does redistribute bikes at night). What I did find interesting, however, is that two of its most nearby stations, 4214 and 4219, are almost always empty. Why? My assumption is that when someone goes to Santa Monica and rents a bike from the pier (an obviously popular spot), they REALLY want to re-park that bike where they got it from, and not have to walk 15+ blocks back. If you zoom into DTLA, for example, we see that most stations average around 50%, because most stations are within four blocks of eachother: if a rider can't find a station, they can always go to a nearby one. This isn't as helpful when Venice's stations are so seperated from Santa Monica (which only has three by the way!)</p>
<p>With all this in mind, I have some reccomendations for the Metro Bikeshare system:</p>
<ol>
<li>Downtown Santa Monica would be a great place for more stations. A lot of visitors rely on the E-Line bike station, so it's often full, so more stations would even out the demand. Wilshire, Ocean Ave. and Broadway would all be great locations, but especially Ocean Front Walk because of the constant foot traffic. Also, the bike routes from Santa Monica to Dockweiler beach are popular year-round. More stations along the beach, particularly farther up north on the PCH, would definitely be popular.</li>
<li>Seeing as a majority of rides (almost 75%) in Santa Monica are through walk-up rentals and day passes, simply having more stations available or more advertising on Metro Bikeshare would be very beneficial. On the other hand, downtown LA, USC, UCLA and Culver City, have well-established stations, and most riders have a monthly pass and annual pass. These would be great locations (particularly the university campuses) to further advertise annual passes for commuting.</li>
</ol>
<p>This was a fun project to work on, and I'm more confident with python and plotly to create the visuals that I need. But more importantly, I really enjoy using Metro Bikeshare, so to find that their rental data and API are public was incredible. I knew some of the difficulties with renting bikes at UCLA and Santa Monica first-hand, and the data helped me see some room for improvement. It's also exciting how popular Metro Bikeshare has gotten within the last few months, and how my visuals will change when I pull in new quarterly data.</p>

From the site:</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">“Bike-sharing systems represent a new generation of traditional bike rentals, where the entire process - from </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">membership and rental to return - has become automatic. With these systems, users can easily rent a bike </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">from a particular location and return it to another.</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">worldwide, which comprise more than 500,000 bicycles.</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">These systems are of great interest due to their </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">important role in addressing traffic, environmental, and health issues.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">In addition to the interesting real-world applications of bike-sharing systems, the characteristics of the data </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">generated by these systems make them attractive for research. Unlike other transport services such as buses </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">or subways, the duration of travel, departure, and arrival positions are explicitly recorded in these systems. </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">This feature turns bike-sharing systems into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">in the city.</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Therefore, it is expected that most of the important events in the city could be detected by </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">monitoring this data.”</span></p>
<p>I was able to get a free year of Metro bikes through UCLA, and while this data is of D.C. rentals, I thought that modeling rental trends would be interesting. With the final model:</p>
<p><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Perceived temperature has the greatest influence on number of bikes rented: when we ran our regression </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">subsets test, it was the very first variable chosen. A 1 degree (F) increase in the temperature correspond to </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">5,596 bikes rented!</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Number of rented bikes also depends a fair amount on the day of the week: the farther into the week, the </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">more predicted bikes rented. </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">The greatest negative influences on rental count are rain (weathersit3), high windspeed, high humidity, and </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">holidays. These all make sense. </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">In all, 79% of the variation in total rented bike counts can be attributed to these variables. We can see that </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">from our regressions subset test that a model with just the date, weather situation and temperature serves </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">well enough, but if we have access to all of these variables, we might as well use them.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">This project can prove helpful for cities that want to adopt a rental bike system and help plan accordingly </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">for total number of stations and bikes needed. The D.C. bike company could also vary prices based on these </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">variables to maximize profits or maximize number of bikes used for certain days or periods. </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">This model only predicts total number of bikes rented per day.</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Future analysis on hourly rental counts </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">or location-based rental information could be interesting. It would also be interesting to create models for </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">casual rentals and registered rentals. We assumed that there was no difference in rental preferences for the </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">sake of this project.</span></p>

<p>According to the source, "Commute trips to work represent 19% of travel miles in the United States," with cars being by far the most used mode of transportation. While cars are convenient, they are one of the deadliest modes of transportation and release harmful emissions into the atmosphere. According to the <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/">California Air Resources Board</a>, vehicles and cars account for approximately one-third of all of California's CO2 emissions and air pollutants.</p>
<p>Besides driving, commuters can take public transportation, bike, walk, work from home, or even carpool. All of these methods help take cars off of our roads, which can significantly cut emissions and save money.</p>

<p>The Bay Area, specifically San Francisco, has the lowest percentage of Californians that drive to work. Los Angeles is also not as car dependent as the rest of Southern California. Let’s zoom in to Southern California so that the area is more visible. It seems that Californians are very dependent on cars for commuting. Los Angeles, the largest circle, is the least dependent city. It also appears that most of the coastal cities don’t commute as much with cars to work. In fact, 72.3% of Californians drive alone for their commute. Now, let’s see which California cities are the most and least dependent on cars.</p>
<figure class="centered align-center"><img loading="lazy"  style="border-radius: 20px;" src="https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/5/gg_bar.png" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw" srcset="https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/5/responsive/gg_bar-xs.png 384w ,https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/5/responsive/gg_bar-sm.png 600w ,https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/5/responsive/gg_bar-md.png 768w ,https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/5/responsive/gg_bar-lg.png 1200w ,https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/5/responsive/gg_bar-xl.png 1600w"  width="900"></figure>
<p>A majority of commuters in Berkeley and San Francisco take public transportation or carpool to work, far above the state-wide averages. It’s also interesting that 19% of commuters in Davis bike to work, then the national average is only 1%! Probably and equally as intriguing question, however, is which cities have improved their environmentally friendly commuting habits? We can keep track of the cities where the percentage of residents aged 16 and older that bike, walk, take public transportation, or work from home have increased the most from 2000 to 2010.</p>
<figure class="centered align-center"><img loading="lazy"  style="border-radius: 20px;" src="https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/5/gg_line.png" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw" srcset="https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/5/responsive/gg_line-xs.png 384w ,https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/5/responsive/gg_line-sm.png 600w ,https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/5/responsive/gg_line-md.png 768w ,https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/5/responsive/gg_line-lg.png 1200w ,https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/5/responsive/gg_line-xl.png 1600w"  width="900"></figure>
<p>Overall, the percent of Californians taking alternative modes of transportation to work had steadily decreased statewide. It's important to note that all of the cities with the fastest transition interestingly all originally had a percentage lower than the state average.</p>
<p>This project was very interesting. I got a lot of practice working with dplyr, graphing locations, organizing data sets, and so much more.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the latest data in this data set is from the 2010 census, which was 12 years ago. It would be fun to find more recent data to see if there are any significant changes (gas prices, for example, are at a record high: how does that affect the average commute?). Our data also focuses only on commutes for Californians with paid work aged 16 and older. The data excludes driving for school, errands, vacations, and more.</p>
<p>Our analysis of the 200 most populated Californian cities helps shed some light on how car-dependent our state is. Many cities don't have a great public bus system. Others have so few sidewalks that walking or biking to work is just impossible. Still, cities have been improving accessibility to more environmentally friendly and economical modes of transportation.</p>
<p>This data set was accessed from <a href="https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/transportation-to-work-2000-2006-2010/resource/87fa0619-708a-4d92-ba5d-879df338b46e">the California Health and Human Services Open Data Website</a>. They provided amazing data dictionaries, narrative examples, and research sources.</p>
<p><a href="https://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/lectures/making-maps-with-R.html">Eric C. Anderson's GitHub repository</a> on making maps in R was an incredible source. I used this reference for all of my ggplot maps.</p>
<p>I used this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_California">Wikipedia article on Californian counties</a> for more great background information and its tables.</p>

<p>. . . and here are the results! I went with just these 6 models.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  style="border-radius: 20px;" src="https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/4/heart_results.png" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw" srcset="https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/heart_results-xs.png 384w ,https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/heart_results-sm.png 600w ,https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/heart_results-md.png 768w ,https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/heart_results-lg.png 1200w ,https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/heart_results-xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="719" height="364"></figure>
<p> </p>
<p>Our logistic regression and ridge classifiers had a 93% accuracy! (however a bit unfortunate that we had more false negatives than positives).</p>
<p>Overall, a patient having any major vessels colored by flouroscopy (1+) were the most at risk of heart disease (around 3 - 4% risk increase for each vessel). Male patients were also more at risk, as well as those with thallasemia and abnormal chest pain.</p>
<p>I completed this Summer of 2022 and it's my first machine learning project. (I know that everyone and their mother has worked with this dataset, but it was more for the learning experience!)</p>
