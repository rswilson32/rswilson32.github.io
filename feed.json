For a better explanation on what this means, this exerpt is from the <a href=\"https://bikeshare.metro.net/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">metro bikeshare website:</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Metro Bike Share system makes bikes available 24/7, 365 days a year in Downtown LA, Central LA, Hollywood, North Hollywood and on the Westside. Metro Bike Share offers convenient round-the-clock access to a fleet of bicycles for short trips. Metro Bike Share is one of LA Metro's multiple public transportation options for Angelenos and visitors to get around.<br><br>Metro Bike Share is a fast, easy, and fun way to ride, anytime. Get a bike from any Metro Bike Share station, go for a ride, and properly return it. It’s easy — just like riding a bike!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since getting my membership, I've been able to bike to my classes, the grocery store, the gym, and more. It's faster than walking, I avoid traffic, and it's overall just fun! I've rarely had issues of crowded stations or empty stations at UCLA, and even if I did, there were always some nearby in Westwood.</p>\n<p>One weekend, my friend and I went to Santa Monica beach, and it was surprisingly a LOT harder to use Metro Bikeshare. Stations were often full and over half a mile away, and at the Metro E line station, there were more people waiting to lock a bike then to rent one!</p>\n<p>With this experience in mind, I wanted to study how popular Metro Bikeshare stations and routes were across Los Angeles. Using LA's <a href=\"https://bikeshare.metro.net/about/data/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">public data</a>, this project is an analysis of Metro Bikeshare's demand over the past year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"620\" height=\"620\" style=\"border-radius: 20px;\" src=\"https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/10/freq_map.html\">\n\t\t&lt;\\iframe&gt;</iframe></div>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"620\" height=\"620\" style=\"border-radius: 20px;\" src=\"https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/10/freq_walk-2.html\">\n\t\t&lt;\\iframe&gt;</iframe></div>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"620\" height=\"620\" style=\"border-radius: 20px;\" src=\"https://rswilson32.github.io/media/posts/10/freq_annual-2.html\">\n\t\t&lt;\\iframe&gt;</iframe></div>\n<p> </p>",

With these systems, users can easily rent a bike </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">from a particular location and return it to another.</span> <span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">worldwide, which comprise more than 500,000 bicycles.</span> <span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">These systems are of great interest due to their </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">important role in addressing traffic, environmental, and health issues.</span></p>\n<p><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">In addition to the interesting real-world applications of bike-sharing systems, the characteristics of the data </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">generated by these systems make them attractive for research. Unlike other transport services such as buses </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">or subways, the duration of travel, departure, and arrival positions are explicitly recorded in these systems. </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">This feature turns bike-sharing systems into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">in the city.</span> <span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Therefore, it is expected that most of the important events in the city could be detected by </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">monitoring this data.”</span></p>\n<p>I was able to get a free year of Metro bikes through UCLA, and while this data is of D.C. rentals, I thought that modeling rental trends would be interesting. With the final model:</p>\n<p><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Perceived temperature has the greatest influence on number of bikes rented: when we ran our regression </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">subsets test, it was the very first variable chosen. A 1 degree (F) increase in the temperature correspond to </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">5,596 bikes rented!</span></p>\n<p><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Number of rented bikes also depends a fair amount on the day of the week: the farther into the week, the </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">more predicted bikes rented. </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The greatest negative influences on rental count are rain (weathersit3), high windspeed, high humidity, and </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">holidays. These all make sense. </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">In all, 79% of the variation in total rented bike counts can be attributed to these variables. We can see that </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">from our regressions subset test that a model with just the date, weather situation and temperature serves </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">well enough, but if we have access to all of these variables, we might as well use them.</span></p>\n<p><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">This project can prove helpful for cities that want to adopt a rental bike system and help plan accordingly </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">for total number of stations and bikes needed. The D.C. bike company could also vary prices based on these </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">variables to maximize profits or maximize number of bikes used for certain days or periods. </span></p>\n<p><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">This model only predicts total number of bikes rented per day.</span> <span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Future analysis on hourly rental counts </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">or location-based rental information could be interesting. It would also be interesting to create models for </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">casual rentals and registered rentals. We assumed that there was no difference in rental preferences for the </span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">sake of this project.</span></p>\n<p>The complete report can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/rswilson32/bikeshare/blob/main/bikeshare.pdf\">here!</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>",
